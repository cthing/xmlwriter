# ![C Thing Software](http://www.cthing.com/images/Logo.gif "C Thing Software") XML Writer Library
A simple yet highly configurable XML writing library. The project is independent of the C Thing
Software build infrastructure so that it may be consumed by core infrastructure plugins. To
identify this project's bootstrap role, it is in the `org.cthing` domain rather than the
`com.cthing` domain.
